## What did I learn about DOCTYPE?
I learne that Its sole purpose is to prevent a browser from switching into so-called “quirks mode” when rendering a document. 
It wa sinteresting to know that doctype ensures that the browser makes a best-effort attempt at following the relevant specifications,
rather than using a different rendering mode that is incompatible with some specifications.

## What did I learn about the head tag? 
I learned that the <head> tag holds information for machine processing. For human-visible information, the <header> tag is used.
